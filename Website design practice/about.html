                    <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

                    <p> Trilingual humanities graduate from the University of Nottingham.
                        
                        I decided to transition into tech upon completing my undergrad in Hispanic Studies having planned to go into the foreign office. I had done modules on modern and contemporary international relations and simultaneously utilised a plethora of data analysis methods and softwares in a research consultantcy role i worked for the cinemagraphic production company, Trailblazer7. The gravity of data drew me into the technological frontier. I completed a DevOps bootcamp with QA learning how to build and launch applications made with Python Flask and connected to a MYSQL database using containers deployed in a DockerSwarm formation. I also created a pipeline on Jenkins to facilitate the installation. The course was enlightening and exposed me to new areas of interest within cloud computing, cyber security and DevOps aswell as automated testing.
